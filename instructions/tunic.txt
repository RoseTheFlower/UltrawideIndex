Additional things to try for an older version of Tunic:

For Microsoft Store, download the Tunic.ultrawide.v1.1.MS.Store.Game.Pass patcher and patch both files as guided by the tool.

For Steam and GOG, launch the game at least once, then quit and go to HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Andrew Shouldice\Secret Legend\ in the registry (Windows Search -> regedit) and correct the decimal Resolution Width and Height values, then set the Fullscreen mode and Use Native values to 1. Make sure to modify the non-Default values.
