The solution removes the artistic side bars that appear at the menu screens, cutscenes and gameplay at 32:9 and wider, and to a lesser extent, at 21:9.

1. [Download the archive](/../../releases/tag/expeditionsrome).
2. Unpack the files to the \ExpeditionsRome\Binaries\Win64\ folder inside the game directory.

To uninstall, simply remove or move the files.

Tested on the latest GOG version at 2560x1080 and 3840x1080.
