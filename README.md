The tool corrects the vertical field of view reduction at 21:9 and wider, perfectly matching to 16:9 at every scene, and removes the black bars from the cutscenes. It also allows to see and control the field of view at any resolution in real time.

1. Go to \Sifu\Binaries\Win64\ in the game folder and rename the Sifu-Win64-Shipping.pdb debug file to Sifu-Win64-Shipping.pdb.bak or remove the file altogether to prevent heavy use of system resources.
2. [Download the tool archive](/../../releases/download/sifu/Sifu.-.Ultrawide.v1.2.zip) and unpack it.
4. Launch the game, followed by the tool.
5. Press the keys as shown.

All trainers containing CE components may trigger some anti-virus software.

Tested on the latest Epic Games Store version at 2560x1080, 3840x1080, and 5112x1440. Thanks to Faz for additional testing.

# Not For Broadcast resolutions unlocker

![GitHub release (by tag)](https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/RoseTheFlower/UltrawideIndex/notforbroadcast/total?label=downloads&style=flat-square)

The small tool unlocks all resolutions in the game. Unfortunately, the inconsistent UI scaling of the game will cause some crucial post-level-summary elements to be out of view at 32:9 and wider, resulting in softlocks, which may or may not be bypassed by forcing the game to close with Alt+F4 and resuming. Use at your own discretion.

1. [Download the archive](/../../releases/tag/notforbroadcast).
2. Unpack the patcher and target the files as instructed.

Tested on the latest Steam version at 2560x1080 and 3840x1080. Not recommended for the latter.

1. [Download the archive](/../../releases/tag/expeditionsrome).
