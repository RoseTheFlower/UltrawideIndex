The tool removes the side black bars and corrects the vertical field of view reduction at the cutscenes at 21:9 and wider resolutions.

2. Launch the game, followed by the tool.
3. Press the key as instructed to toggle the fix on and off in real time.

All trainers containing CE components may trigger some anti-virus software.

Tested on the latest Game Pass version at 2560x1080, 3840x1080, and 5760x1080.

The field of view calculation formula implementation was based on killer-m's work.

# Not For Broadcast resolutions unlocker

![GitHub release (by tag)](https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/RoseTheFlower/UltrawideIndex/notforbroadcast/total?label=downloads&style=flat-square)

The small tool unlocks all resolutions in the game. Unfortunately, the inconsistent UI scaling of the game will cause some crucial post-level-summary elements to be out of view at 32:9 and wider, resulting in softlocks, which may or may not be bypassed by forcing the game to close with Alt+F4 and resuming. Use at your own discretion.

1. [Download the archive](/../../releases/tag/notforbroadcast).
2. Unpack the patcher and target the files as instructed.

Tested on the latest Steam version at 2560x1080 and 3840x1080. Not recommended for the latter.

3. Press the hotkey as instructed.

All trainers based on CE components may trigger some anti-virus software.
